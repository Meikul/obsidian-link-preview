### Create visual previews of links in your notes.
Keep track of the places your knowledge is coming from by embedding visual previews of the links in your notes. Make your notes easier to read, easier to share, and nicer to look at.

## How to Use It

There are a few ways to create a link preview:
1. Copy the URL into your clipboard
2. Run the `Link Preview: Create Link Preview` command
#### Or, if it's an existing link in your notes
1. Select the URL **OR** place your cursor next to or somewhere inside the URL.
2. Run the `Link Preview: Create Link Preview` command

Both of these methods create a code block with the language type `linkp` which contains your URL.
